AI gets a board to make move, it can be empty or with a move form computer or some moves from itself too.
it needs to check all the empty places and put its symbol there one by one
for each placement of symbol assume some random move by the human player which could be made by the human.
now for each possible human move make possible ai moves and so on.
unless you face the base case where either human or the ai won or it was a draw.


AI(board):
    for each '-' place:
        makemove(i, j)

makemove(board, i, j):
   i, j___'-' place is now ai_symbol
   does i, j move concluded anything? is the new score greater?
        and human move().


human(board)
    for each '-' place:
        '-' place is now human_symbol
        has concluded? human won?
        and ai_move(board).



 How the curr code is working??  31-7-2025
 Now when we run our code.
 the bode goes to ai-player it checks if the hash has the answer if not it moves to the ai move method
 at ai move method clone another board to avoid conflict.
 check for first empty place
